A coding editor for the biologist.  This is designed to help non-comuter-scientists with the 
following abilities


1.  Navigate remote server files
2.  Build data pipelines
3.  Configure environments, especially conda
4.  Work with High Performace Computing systems 
5.  Lessen the amount of Linux and configuration needed to start


This is under the philosophy that the limiting factor for genomics, bioinformatics, or 
any other biology based reserach should be biology, not computational theory.

Contributing
---
All contributions should go through git pull requests.


Contributions can be bug reports, feature requests, or changes to the repo.  

A bug report should include what steps to reproduce the error
and any data you might find prudent (OS, stack trace if possible, the weather, etc)

Feature requests should include what you want to see, why you think its necessary, and possibly implementation details.

Changes to the repo. Make one of the above issues first. Once a  plan is reached and implemented, make a pull request with the repo and it'll be reviewed for incorporation into the project.
