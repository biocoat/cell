Cell
---

A coding editor for the biologist.  This is designed to help non-comuter-scientists with the 
following skills:


1.  Navigate remote server files
2.  Build data pipelines
3.  Configure environments, especially conda
4.  Work with High Performace Computing systems 
5.  Lessen the amount of Linux and configuration needed to start


This is under the philosophy that the limiting factor for genomics, bioinformatics, or 
any other biology based reserach should be biology, not computational theory.

Build
---

### Requirements
git

Node and npm (built using Node version 10.16.3 and Npm version 6.9.0)

Yarn: A package manager that handles Node packages and builds the application. It can work with npm, but yarn is prefered.

2.  `cd cell`
3.  `yarn`
4.  `yarn start`


Contributing
---
All contributions should go through the Issues tab.


Contributions can be bug reports, feature requests, or changes to the repo.  

A bug report should include what steps to reproduce the error
and any data you might find prudent (OS, stack trace if possible, the weather, etc)

Feature requests should include what you want to see, why you think it's necessary, and possibly implementation details.

Changes to the repo. Make one of the above issues first. Once a  plan is reached and implemented, make a pull request with the repo and it'll be reviewed for incorporation into the project.
